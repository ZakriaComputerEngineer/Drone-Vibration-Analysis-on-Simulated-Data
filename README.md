# Drone-Vibration-Analysis-on-Simulated-Data
A comprehensive project that simulates drone flights, collects vibrational data using smartphone sensors, filters the collected signals, and performs statistical analysis and visualization. The future goal is to build a dataset for training machine learning models to classify motor health, propeller condition, structural integrity, and stability.
